Days

Day 1
-------

Woke up, rented car, Tomek drove us from Krakow to Dynow. About 3 hours. Most of it by the new Dynow to Rzezow highway in 1 hour, then 2 hours for the rest down windy country roads.

Arrived at Dynow around 2pm. Found the bibliothetica around 3pm but it was closing (it was Saturday) and the librarian didn't want to help us. Found the graveyard which was fenced in, but the gatekeeper let us in. The tall trees, screeching crows, and memorials made it a very intense experience. 


Tips for Jews tracking down roots in Poland
=============================================

* Bring a Polish translator. Seriously.
* It doesn't hurt to know Hebrew either.
* Bring small gifts for people who maintain things like libraries and archives.
* Rent a car. That means an international driver's license (or local driver) and ability to drive stick shift.
* Poland, outside or railway and a small highways still under active construction, is curvy country roads. This makes distances very large. In the US 200 miles is 3 hours, in Poland it takes 6-8 hours to traverse the same distance.

Researching my family.
